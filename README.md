# djangoApp

## Purpose
Using Tango with Django to complete coursework for 'Web Application Systems' course Semester 2. I will work thtough chapters 3-10 of the Tango with Django book to meet the requirements, ensuring all tests are passed on way.
Coding and commit practices will most likely not be the same as a normal project.
